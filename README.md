-View binding.

-Hilt as dependency injection.

-Navigation component (one activity and four fragments).

-Shimmer layout from https://facebook.github.io/shimmer-android/.

-Snap helper and attach it to recycler view to snap to the center of items of recyler view.

-list adapter and DiffUtil to get the difference between two lists and outputs a list of update operations that converts the first list into the second one,and show some animations (in search activity).
